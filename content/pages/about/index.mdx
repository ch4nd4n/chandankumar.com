## Chandan Kumar

If it isnâ€™t obvious; Name Chandan Kumar. Age is inconsistent, albeit consistently been(more or less) in Bangalore. 
I work as a Software Engineer, and my blog may not be very obvious of what I work on, 
these days its dabbling between Java and NodeJs. I am not fascinated by any specific programming language and find flaws 
with every stack. IMO Optimizing application performance is exciting, tiring and painfully tiring, sometimes.

## Site

Powered by Gatsby. I was confused between NextJs and Gatsby, but chose Gatsby.

I have been experimenting with web for years, to build a perfect solution for my online presence. 
These web pages, what you see right now is powered by Jekyll. I used Octopress prior to Jekyll 
but it is dormant now. Oh and in the past I have tried way too many things. But then as its said 
keep things simple and blah blah. So here it is, hello world of Web. Plain old HTML, topped with 
CSS and JavaScript. ~~I would like to make this PWA but thats for another time.~~ PWA is an ongoing
process and I hope to keep adding something or the other over a period of time.
