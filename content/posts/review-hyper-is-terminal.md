### What?

> A terminal built on web technologies[https://hyper.is](https://hyper.is/)

Just a terminal. I did not find anything extremely useful. Looks good, but then look is subjective.

### Why?

Found it tiny bit fancy and thats about it. Hyper doesn't feel slower than default terminal or for that matter iTerm2. May be its a tick faster compared to iTerm2.

### How?

Well detailed instructions is available on their site, but on a mac if you have `brew` installed

```shell
brew cask install hyper
```
Once installed you may want to dock it Mac docking bar

### Search

* generally restart after a plugin install
