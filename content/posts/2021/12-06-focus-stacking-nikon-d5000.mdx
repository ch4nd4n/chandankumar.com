![Stink Bug Macro Photo Focus Stacking](./stink-bug-focus-stacking-macro.jpg)

Macro Photo of stink bug, using 2 images to reduce DOF.
Took this image in 2019 but could not stack it, as I could not find stacking
app free of cost. One of the cons of Mac!

### What is focus stacking?

> technique which combines multiple images taken at different focus distances
> to give a resulting image with a greater depth of field (DOF) than any of the
> individual source images.

### Quick tutorial

To take shots at different focus distance, it's advised to use focus slider, I got one, but I rarely
use it. The issue is that in the wild it's pretty useless. To get this shot I shot burst of shot
while moving very slowly. It's a hit or a miss. This particular image, I got just
2 usable shot.
Software for focus stacking has come a long way, I used Affinity by Serif. It worked.
