![nextjs tailwind emotion tutorial](./tailwind-banner.png)

Quickest way to setup Next.js with Tailwinds CSS is to use the official nextjs example.

> 2021 is nearing end and my preferred way to build react app is Next.js with Tailwind.css

```sh
yarn create next-app --example with-tailwindcss-emotion my-app
cd my-app
yarn dev
```

That's it. The dev server should be accessible at http://localhost:3000

As of Nov 2021, you may get following error(in the past above three lines would set you up).

```log
error - ./pages/_app.js
TypeError: Cannot read property 'theme' of undefined
```

To solve this issue I had to make couple of changes.

1. Downgrade tailwindcss to 2.1.4 in `package.json`
2. comment out `mode jit` in tailwinds.config.js

With above changes done, I had to

1. delete `node_modules` and `.next`
2. install dependency

After making above two changes

```sh
rm -rf node_modules
rm -rf .next
yarn
yarn dev
```

The issue is described at https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/26337 kind of solved as well.
