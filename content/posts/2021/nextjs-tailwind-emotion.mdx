Quickest way to setup Next.js with Tailwinds CSS.

> 2021 is nearing end and my preferred way to build react app is Next.js with Tailwind.css

```sh
yarn create next-app --example with-tailwindcss-emotion my-app
cd my-app
yarn dev
```

As of Nov 2021, you will get following error

```log
error - ./pages/_app.js
TypeError: Cannot read property 'theme' of undefined
```

To solve this issue I had to make couple of changes.

1. Downgrade tailwindcss to 2.1.4 in `package.json`
2. comment out `mode jit` in tailwinds.config.js

With above changes done, I had to
1. delete `node_modules` and `.next` 
2. install dependency


After making above two changes

```sh
rm -rf node_modules
rm -rf .next
yarn 
yarn dev
```

The issue is described at https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/26337 kind of solved as well.
