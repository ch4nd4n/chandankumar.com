This site is powered by Lekoarts theme, while it has a lot of features, I wanted
to change styling and some text contents that the theme defaults to.

To this I figured I have to change the Home layout in Lekoart.
I copied `homepage.tsx` from `node_modules/@lekoarts/gatsby-theme-minimal-blog/src/components/` to
project `src` folder.

Gatsby official documentation does cite how to do this, but the chances are that one might
miss it out. Following is what the Gatsby documentation says about shadowing

> Gatsby themes introduce a concept called “shadowing”. This feature allows users to
> replace a file in the src directory that is included in the webpack bundle with their
> own implementation. This works for React components, pages in src/pages, JSON files,
> TypeScript files, as well as any other imported file (such as .css) in your site.

### Lekoarts Gatsby theme shadowing

After copying the file from node_modules to apt src folder, the references needs to be updated
for example to something below

```tsx:title=homepage.tsx
import Layout from "@lekoarts/gatsby-theme-minimal-blog/src/components/layout";
import Title from "@lekoarts/gatsby-theme-minimal-blog/src/components/title";
import Listing from "@lekoarts/gatsby-theme-minimal-blog/src/components/listing";
import List from "@lekoarts/gatsby-theme-minimal-blog/src/components/list";
```

Refer to https://github.com/ch4nd4n/chandankumar.com/blob/45e8fcb2625023d2683d6d9c9464411b774ba700/src/%40lekoarts/gatsby-theme-minimal-blog/components/homepage.tsx

Effective path for this file is `/src/@lekoarts/gatsby-theme-minimal-blog/components/homepage.tsx`
