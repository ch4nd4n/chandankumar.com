  Migrated site from Jekyll to Gatsby. It was a tough choice to make, but
  confusion was due to Nextjs

Finally switched from [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) based blogging system to Gatsby. I had this working on a separate beta CNAME for sometime now, but decided to take a plunge finally.

Right now I have used a theme called minimal by LekoArt plus I am using Netlify CMS for managing content. I must say, no complains at all. At least so far.

**Update**

There are few corrections to be made to the template. I am going follow up this Gatsby platform with some kind of comments system.
