description: Migrated site from Jekyll to Gatsby

Finally switched from Jekyll based blogging system to Gatsby. I had this working on a separate beta cname for sometime now, but decided to take a plunge finally.

Right now I have used a theme called minimal by LekoArt plus I am using Netlify CMS for managing content. I must say, no complains at all. At least so far.
