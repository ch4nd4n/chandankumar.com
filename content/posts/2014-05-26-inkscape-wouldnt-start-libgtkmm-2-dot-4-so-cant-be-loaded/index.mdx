For some reason Inkscape wasn't opening up on my system.
To figure out the issue, I started it from terminal and noticed
that it throws error 

    inkscape: error while loading shared libraries: libgtkmm-2.4.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

Do what now? Well the most obvious thing, reinstall it.
