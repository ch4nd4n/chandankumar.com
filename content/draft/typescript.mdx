A brief guide on setting up Typescript, eslint and prettier
with `node.js`. Treat this as a guide which describes how to
setup typescript from the scratch. The intent isn't to
give introduction to TypeScript but how to set it up. Of course
there are automated way of setting up Typescript, but this will
elaborate on what goes behind the scene.

TLDR; Use eslint to lint source over tsconfig or prettier.

> For this guide I am using `yarn` but feel free to use `npm` or whatever else.

## How to configure Typescript(node) project

1. Install Typescript, eslint and prettier dependency
2. Generate relevant config files
3. Update package.json with relevant scripts.

## Installing dependency

Add typescripts as dev dependency

```bash
yarn init -y
yarn add typescript --dev
ls node_modules/.bin
```

At this point of time you are all set to start using typescript.
Although, to make things a bit more convinient, we would configure
few things that allows you to compile TS to JS.

Update `package.json` and add the following to it.

```json
"scripts": {
    "tsc": "tsc"
  },
```

Above allows us to do something like `yarn tsc`.

Add Typescript source in `src` folder

```bash
mkdir src
touch src/index.ts
```

Add relevant content to index.ts (or your entire code base)

```ts:title=src/index.ts
function getMessage() {
  return "hello world";
}
```

Use `tsc` to compile ts to js and run it.

```bash
yarn tsc src/*.ts or npx tsc src/*.ts
node src/index.js
```

### Better management of Compiling and generated files

You may have realized that compiling using tsc spits out the generated
files in the same folder as the source. To fix that we can piggyback on
typescript config

init typescript config

```
yarn tsc --init
```

update `tsconfig.json` to keep source in `src` folder and output in `dist`

```sh
rm ./src/*.js
```

```json
"rootDir": "./src", /* Specify the root folder within your source files. */
"outDir": "./dist", /* Specify an output folder for all emitted files. */
```

```json:title=package.json
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node dist/index.js",
    "tsc": "tsc"
  },
```

```bash
yarn start
```

#### Add linter

https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started
https://typescript-eslint.io/

```sh
yarn add --dev @typescript-eslint/parser @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin eslint typescript
yarn create @eslint/config # npm init @eslint/config
```

```
✔ How would you like to use ESLint? · style
✔ What type of modules does your project use? · commonjs
✔ Which framework does your project use? · none
✔ Does your project use TypeScript? · No / Yes
✔ Where does your code run? · node
✔ How would you like to define a style for your project? · guide
✔ Which style guide do you want to follow? · airbnb
✔ What format do you want your config file to be in? · JavaScript
```

```json:title=package.json
"lint": "eslint",
```

now lets lint source

```bash
yarn lint src/*.ts
```

```
yarn add -D prettier
yarn prettier --check .
```

Above may give some errors

```
Checking formatting...
[warn] .eslintrc.js
[warn] src/index.ts
[warn] tsconfig.json
[warn] Code style issues found in the above file(s). Forgot to run Prettier?
```

You could fix above using something like

```bash
yarn prettier --write .
git diff
```

Although if you do a linting, you would see an error

```bash
yarn lint
```

```log
2:13  error  Strings must use singlequote  quotes
```

This is due to conflicting default rules of prettier with eslint. To fix this, we can update
prettier to use eslint rules instead.

```bash
yarn add -D eslint-plugin-prettier
```

Update `.prettierrc.json`

```json
{
  "trailingComma": "es5",
  "tabWidth": 2,
  "semi": true,
  "singleQuote": true
}
```

Enable and disable prettier plugin to test out things.
