SQLite is a lightweight RDBMS. It's dead simple to use and has a small footprint. I am using it in production and it's been good so far.

## Install

Depends on your OS. For example, on Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install sqlite3` or on MacOS: `brew install sqlite3`

Figure out how to install it on your OS. You can also use the [SQLite CLI](https://www.sqlite.org/cli.html) to interact with the database.

Notes on using SQLite CLI 

### 1. Create or Open a Database

```bash
sqlite3 mydatabase.db
```

### 2. Create a Table


#### Command to Create Table `user`
```sql
CREATE TABLE user (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT,
    email TEXT UNIQUE
);
```

### Steps

1. **Open SQLite CLI**:
   ```sh
   sqlite3 mydatabase.db
   ```

2. **Execute the Create Table Command**:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE user (
       id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
       name TEXT,
       email TEXT UNIQUE
   );
   ```

This command creates a table named `user` with columns `id`, `name`, and `email` (with `email` being unique).
